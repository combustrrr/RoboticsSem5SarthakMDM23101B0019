# ðŸŽ¬ Quick Demonstration Guide - Assignment 1

## ðŸš€ Instant Demo Commands

### 1. Main Assignment Launcher (Recommended)
```bash
python main.py
```
**Result**: Interactive menu to launch Part B or Part C demonstrations

### 2. Part B - Basic Robotic Arm Demo  
```bash
cd assignment1/partb
python main.py
```
**Result**: 2D robotic arm simulation with pick and place operations

### 3. Part C - Advanced Features Demo
```bash
cd assignment1/partc  
python main.py
```
**Result**: 4-DOF arm, 3D PyBullet simulation, conveyor sorting system
