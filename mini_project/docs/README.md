# Mini Project: Interactive 3D JCB Robotic Arm Simulation

This directory contains the interactive 3D robotic arm simulation system designed as a mini project for computer graphics demonstrations.

## Features

### üéÆ Real-Time Interactive Control System
- **4-DOF Control**: Boom, Stick, Bucket, and Bucket Rotation joints with real-time response
- **Multiple Camera Systems**: Wide, close, side, top, and dramatic cinematic angles
- **Interactive Sliders**: Immediate joint position control with smooth motion planning
- **Keyboard Controls**: Professional control scheme for live demonstrations

### üé¨ VFX-Quality 3D Rendering
- **Authentic JCB Design**: Professional yellow/orange construction equipment styling
- **Advanced Lighting**: 3-point lighting setup with dynamic shadows and reflections
- **Realistic Materials**: PBR-style metallic surfaces with proper specular highlights
- **Construction Environment**: Complete worksite with barriers, dirt piles, and construction materials

## Usage

### Interactive Real-Time Control
```bash
python interactive_3d_robotic_arm.py
```
This opens an interactive window where you can:
- Use sliders to control joint positions in real-time
- Use keyboard controls (WASD, arrow keys) for live operation
- Switch between camera angles (1-5 keys)
- See immediate visual feedback from your inputs

### VFX Quality Demonstrations
```bash
python vfx_robotic_arm.py
```
This provides:
- Cinema-quality rendering with advanced effects
- Professional demonstration sequences
- Cinematic camera movements
- VFX-grade visual quality

### Demo Generation
```bash
python generate_interactive_3d_demo.py    # Generate interactive demos
python create_enhanced_3d_demo.py         # Create enhanced presentations
python comprehensive_demo_generator.py    # Full demonstration suite
```

## Interactive Workspace Features

The system provides a real-time interactive workspace where you can:

1. **Live Joint Control**: Move robotic arm joints using sliders with immediate visual response
2. **Camera Control**: Switch between multiple viewing angles in real-time
3. **Keyboard Interaction**: Direct keyboard control for professional demonstrations
4. **Real-Time Feedback**: Live position displays and joint angle information
5. **Physics Simulation**: Realistic physics with collision detection and gravity
